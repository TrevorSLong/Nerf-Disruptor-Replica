## Notes

#### Uses
   * If you are a student: DO NOT turn any of these files as part of your project. You may use these files as inspiration or help in completing your own project but do not use any part of this project as your own.
   * Anybody else: Personal use only, Don't try to make money off our work.
#### Other notes:
   * Assemblies probably will be broken due to files in different places on GitHub. Locating the files should fix this.
   * The model does not fit together perfectly, if 3D printed, don't expect it to fit and work without modification. Its close, not perfect.
